[b]Q&A[/b]

[i]What is Nationalism Extended?[/i]

Nationalism Extended (NE) is first and foremost a modification of the generic focus tree, mainly with its namesake function of granting tag unique, historical claims, cores and/or puppet wargoals through unlocking either "Nationalism" or "Internationalism" in the generic focus tree, or through certain decisions. This comes in addition to starter claims/cores Paradox have already graced certain nations with. Now you can really restore a minor nation to its former historical glory.

In addition the generic tree has recieved a significant buff through better focuses, shortening of the time some of them take, and lastly 6 brand new political focuses and 5 other focuses (some locked behind technologies). A goal of mine is making every focus interesting in itself, rather than just a path to other goodies. Though still, the lower/harder to reach focuses are meant to be the cream of the crop.



[i]Why "Nationalism" and "Internationalism" specifically?[/i]

For the sake of realism it's been put in the paths of the more blatantly ruthless ideologies of Fascism and Communism. Due to the League of Nations solving issues in international courts as well as education, democratisation and the spread of human rights (which would see to it that eventually modern democracies became more peaceful), interventionist/neutral democracies will mostly not be given claims/cores by focus as they really didn't do much conquering in the period.

Communism and especially the different forms of Fascism, however, saw open warfare as a more acceptable way to further their goals. Why Fascism gets this should be clear with the whole "glory to our nation" rhetoric. As for Communism a goal was spreading the Revolution, and in history the USSR first and foremost reconquered their former territories (lost in WW1) to do this, such as Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltics, Finland and eastern Poland. So naturally, so would minor nations!



[i]Which countries have significant amounts of new gameplay?[/i]

All generic focus tree users and Hungary/Austria-Hungary especially, and there are also smaller amounts of buffs and/or flexibility with focuses and decisions for Poland, Yugoslavia and a lot of other countries that have received land reintegration decisions to gain some extra cores. Switching to a non-aligned/traditional government has also been made possible with decisions (though it can be hard). Many generic ideas have been significantly buffed/tweaked too.



[i]What are your requirements for giving a nation a claim or core?[/i]

Claims I've mainly tried to limit to areas held by the relevant country in the modern age (post 1500), while cores will have to have a significant minority (or majority) population of the relevant nation, or a population which once considered themselves nationals. Cultural similarity and cooperative populations have also been considered. All in all I'm a lot stricter on it than Mussolini was, where Greece being a part of the Roman Empire made them "fair game" to Italy. Claims/cores are still up for civilized debate though, and may be removed, or more can be added if a good case can be made for it. Feedback is very welcome! 



[b]Full list of features[/b]

- Extra cores/claims and puppet war goals unlocked for nations through focus trees and/or decisions. Affected tags so far:
Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Guangxi Clique, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mengkukuo, Mexico, Mongolia, New Zealand, Nepal, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Portugal, the PRC, Romania, Serbia, Shanxi, Siam, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tibet, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, Venezuela, Xibei San Ma, Yugoslavia and Yunnan.

- Buffs and balancing for the minor tree and 6 brand new focuses. Buffs include PP, factories (1 arms, 1 naval, 2 oil refineries + 4 building slots), production modifiers, more manpower and research bonuses. Manpower for fascists has gone from 7% to 8%, while all other paths have received a hard buff from 0% to 6%. Nations going the "liberty path" can also justify wargoals at a lower WT through political focuses now.

- Buffs to the Polish, Hungarian and Yugoslavian focus trees. Many ideas have been added and buffed throughout their trees, and they now provide more manpower, better industrial bonuses, and/or new cores/claims. The Hungarian tree even has 5 new focuses.

- While fascists still have the highest base manpower bonus, communists get extra non-core manpower, traditionalists get mobilization speed, and democrats get extra recruitable population factor (representing people scrambling to defend democracy when needed at higher conscription laws).

- Slightly more active AI minors. Chances of them going collectivist have been increased a tad.



[b]Fixes[/b]

- Fixed Italian national focus "Claims on France", through adding additional requirements for the focus. This means you can now play fascist France without Italy getting free land off of you with neither them nor Germany having ever won a war against you. Vive la France!

- Fixed readability of fascist and communist ideas/national spirits by diversifying the icons. They now make more sense and you won't have the same icons for different ideas.
