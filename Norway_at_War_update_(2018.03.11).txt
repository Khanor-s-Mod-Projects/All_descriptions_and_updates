Version 1.2.0a - Small fixes and localisation corrections/improvements

[b]Localisation[/b]
[list]
[*]Fixed errors in Norwegian decisions to prepare for a Monarchist civil war. Also some removed redundant spacing here.

[*]Shortened certain event texts that were too long (and would go under the option buttons).

[*]Improved on certain event texts as well.

[*]Reworked the description text of "Delegate Merchant Fleet Control" focus.

[*]Fixed certain capitalization errors in cosmetic countries' names.[/list]



[b]Balance and fixes[/b]
[list]
[*]Added extra checks for the election cycle event of '38, so it will not trigger if in a civil war or if having ended up with abolished elections in the Monarchist path.

[*]Fixed Norwegian civil war event being shown as a standard event instead of a news event (causing the news event picture to not fit).

[*]Added a bit of war support to certain core and/or wargoal granting focuses.

[*]Made one of the infantry equipment bonuses into a bonus for either infantry weapons or artillery. The focus tree lacked artillery research bonuses before.[/list]

Version 1.2.0b - Single fix update

[b]Balance and fixes[/b]
[list]
[*]Correction for missing "OR" statement in the election cycle event of 1938. Now it correctly doesn't trigger either if Norway is in a civil war or they're an absolute monarchy, rather than both being necessary.[/list]
