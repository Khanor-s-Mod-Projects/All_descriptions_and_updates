Version 1.1.3a, Mid-sized Flavor, AI and Localisation Update, with some map improvements (1.7.* Hydra compatible)

[b]Features/Content[/b]
[list]
[*]The main feature of this patch (though not immediately noticeable) has to be the two new AI files. The first one of these handles the main lines in what the AI countries should research, with especially things like infantry tech, industry and land doctrine highly prioritized, with electronics and air doctrines somewhat boosted. Naval equipment and naval doctrine have been less prioritized generally. There are some specific strategies too which add back some naval focus to certain naval focused nations, and one that does this to a lesser degree for partially naval focused nations. There's also some further special strategies such as the United Kingdom and Germany starting to prioritize armor research some time during 1916 in an effort to break the stalemate, Bulgaria ramping up artillery research focus when they have their designer, and Serbia focusing hard on infantry tech and land doctrine if at war with Austria-Hungary or Italy.

[*]Special AI military strategies, with Germany finally prioritizing the west initially if going for Schlieffen, and both them and Austria-Hungary remaining on the defensive in the east initially if at war with Russia when this is ongoing. There's also attempts at simulating some historical campaigns if historical focuses is checked before playing the game. This includes, but is not limited too, the Italian Isonzo river battles (Italian attack, Austro-Hungarian defense), the Gallipoli campaign (the UK and Australia primarily), Verdun (split into three, German attack, German defense and French counterattack), the Brusilov Offensive and the Kaiserschlacht. Feeling good about these, but let's see if they work before celebrating.

[*]Added two starting ideas to Persia (one timed). These have their own focus icons and localisation already.

[*]Added one new idea picture and one new event picture.

[*]Added 4 new cities to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, 4 to the Kingdom of Romania and 2 to Russian held Bessarabia. Also moved Brăila to the south both to make room for the bigger city of Galati, and because it was slightly misplaced.

[*]Rejigged the Victory Point values of certain cities in A-H and Romania, based on historical populations and their importance. Examples include Triest, Brassó, Salzburg and Craiova.[/list]

[*]Added descriptions to 4 Bulgarian Balkan focuses, 2 Bulgarian Aviation focuses and 4 Serbian Balkan focuses.

[*]Renamed the Austro-Hungarian states and cities further (Slovenia --> Krain, Ljubljana --> Laibach, Trieste --> Triest).[/list]



[b]Balance and fixes[/b]
[list]
[*]From previous update (1.1.3, no room to write it in the changelogs there): Improved how historical city names are applied to Norwegian and Ottoman starting cities, now the task of handing certain cities period appropriate names is done through their respective history files rather than the starting event.

[*]Actually switched a civilian factory and a military factory around between Struma Valley and Stara Planina to represent Sofia Artillery Arsenal this time. Last patch where I claimed to do this I accidentally edited the 1936 buildings only. Also readded an airbase to Struma Valley (Sofia) to represent the bases of the Bulgarian Aviation Squad.

[*]All focus given research bonuses for Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire are now buffed to 40% (most common) or 50% bonus speed to make them sensible and decent with the new research speed instead of research time bonuses introduced by Paradox in one of the newer patches.

[*]Rebalanced some later Bulgarian Balkan focuses. Now they give less political power, but more army, naval and air experience.

[*]The event giving Bulgaria the temporary "Bulgarian Nationalistic Fervor" national spirit/idea no longer checks for if at war with Montenegro, primarily because it's now possible to get Montenegro to stay out of that war or take your side, but also because it was an unnecessary check.

[*]The non-aggression pact with Romania is now removed for Bulgaria if they do the "Expansionist Policy" focus.

[*]Rebalanced the Schlieffen Plan idea to hopefully put in the final piece of the puzzle needed for a historical German advance early in the war. This is now a very powerful idea, but it comes at a cost that will hopefully grind the Germans down a little towards the end of the grand assault.[/list]

Version 1.1.3b, Map and Authenticity Improvements, AI Strategy Tuning and further Balancing (1.7.* Hydra compatible)

[b]Features/Content[/b]
[list]
[*]Introduced Impassable Terrain to all the relevant Saharan desert states, like the base game. Now you won't unrealistically have to fight for every sand dune.

[*]What is now Kufra starts in British control/ownership which is more historical than it being under Ottoman control/ownership at the start.

[*]Pristina, Tirana and Vlorë are all worth more Victory Points now. This should make them fit with the standards around them a lot better.

[*]New cities/towns! Added Pancsova to Austria-Hungary, Smederevo to Serbia and Elbasan to Albania.

[*]Added some new opinion modifiers to the mod.[/list]



[b]Localisation[/b]
[list]
[*]Renamed an Italian focus to fit the fact that what is now Libya wasn't named so until 1934. Switched it to the period appropriate Tripolitana.

[*]Renamed states in Ottoman Tripolitana to avoid said modern name. The two "Libyan Desert" states are now named "Desert of Tripoli" and "Kufra".

[*]Improved the writing of certain decision and idea localisations.

[*]Krakow state owned by Austria-Hungary is now named Krakau.[/list]



[b]Balance and fixes[/b]
[list]
[*]Switched some of the powerful TGW opinion modifiers (that I added to a Bulgarian focus last update) with the more modest and fitting ones I created for this update. This is applied to one of Bulgaria's early Balkan focuses.

[*]Further tweaked the starter (WW1) land doctrine with bonuses that are harder to choose between (for the split paths) and that fit the names and descriptions of the individual doctrine technologies better.

[*]All Bulgarian focus given land doctrine bonuses have been nerfed a little from 50% to 40%. 50% I figured was a little too fast.

[*]Fixed and tweaked some of the AI research priorities/focuses so they should work better now (if TGW's research woes hadn't stretched as deep as I now see they do). Still, maybe things will get a little better, for now at least? Also improved the general formatting of the AI research priorities (the ai focuses seem to need to be lowercase in their entirety, except for an eventual country tag). This included duplications of some AI research focuses to apply to many different tags where relevant.

[*]What can be fixed is AI war plans, and those I added last patch. These were ever so slightly tweaked a little now, mainly by me adding the "consider_weak"-AI modifiers where I found it relevant.

[*]Foolproofed the Italo-Turkish war start event just a little bit.

[*]Removed Ottoman cores on Ottoman Tripolitania to represent their fading hold on the territory. However, what was added was the possibility for Egypt to get a core on Kufra should the Ottomans win the Great War and get Egypt as a subject, so I guess that's a meagre comfort for all this at least.[/list]
