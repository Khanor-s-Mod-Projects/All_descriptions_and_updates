Version 1.4.1 - Large feature update and polish, Railroad Development, tech sharing and more (1.11.* Barbarossa compatible)

[b]Content[/b]
[list]
[*]Added new traits, especially personality traits, to some Norwegian commanders to be more fair with them. Now every commander has some starting traits at least.

[*]Jacob Ager Laurantzon now starts as a field marshal rather than a general to represent his high rank and seniority.

[*]Reworked "Marinens Hovedverft" to incorporate some of the historical torpedo and torpedo patrol boat priorities they had at the time. Also added some decent submarine bonuses, so it now has a general-purpose coastal defense feel to it. Reduced the surface visibility bonus on cruisers/screens a bit to compensate for their attack buffs.

[*]Added a new decision category, "Railroad Development" with about 17 decisions which may be available depending on circumstances. These become available after the first railroad focus, and are integrated with both focuses. It counts your overall railroad development, and new projects and (state) benefits become available at higher levels. They cost a lot of industry, but you can build, improve, re-gauge, electrify and extend railroads, in decisions that can be historical, plausible and/or ahistorical. Some plausible ones arguably should have been historical.

[*]Added two new dynamic modifiers for states that go with the "Railroad Development"-decisions.

[*]Added new technology sharing group for the monarchist path, enabled through decisions after some political focuses. These have their own events, effects, decisions for improving the facilities and decisions for inviting even more members after the initial creation.

[*]Added a few cooperation decisions with Iceland for them in the same faction and/or a subject state of Norway. Also added a new news event related to one of these.

[*]Added two new event pictures, one news event and one standard event.

[*]Added two new opinion modifiers used in some of the new decisions/events.[/list]



[b]Localisation[/b]
[list]
[*]Added localisation for all new additions, such as events.

[*]Switched the localisation between the reintegration of Jamtland and Båhuslen, which was the wrong way around for the flavor text (though effects worked as intended.) These should now be less confusing.

[*]Renamed starting VP in Båhulsen/Bohuslän, was Marstrand, is now Uddevalla which is far bigger and more important, especially economically. This outweighs the VP's location within the province by a lot. As long as the VP is within the correct province, I find it acceptable.

[*]Fixed and improved spelling, tag-targeters in the localisation, word use, punctuation-/parenthesis use and made more liberal use of the often superior to TAG.GetName, ROOT.GetName and FROM.GetName where sensible.

[*]Added unique subject name for non-aligned Finland as subject of non-aligned Norway, somewhat inspired by EU IV and the geographic situation.

[*]Further improved readability of focuses through better formatting and further improved tooltips. Also tided up the readability of the "Ski Infantry"-unique tech when it's mentioned.

[*]Tidied up file formatting and in-file comments.

[*]Renamed a couple of focuses and ideas, both their names, and in some cases their ID. NaW should have a more concise focus-/idea-naming system now. If stuck with seeming duplicates upon loading save it can be fixed with console commands and maybe debug-mode if needed. You may ask me for help if needed.[/list]



[b]Balance and fixes[/b]
[list]
[*]Reworked priorities for decision categories.

[*]The "Armed Neutrality"-decisions which petition major powers for an alliance now send the request-event even faster to make them more useful (as opposed to just trying to join factions by waiting for an invite from a major power like the United Kingdom.) Events asking to join their faction are now sent in just three hours instead of six hours like earlier.

[*]Reworked the old naval idea line, now less convoy (production) spam, and instead gave them some max speed improvements to represent the modern Norwegian Merchant fleet at the time: Convoy Production cost -25% --> -10%, Convoy Max Speed +0% --> +10%.

[*]The late game idea for monarchist Norway, "Preserving the Kingdom" now still lets you send volunteers without a huge army, and to continue its defensive nature, we now have 20% reduced damage to garrisons in it too.

[*]Tanks will never be the strength of Norway in this mod, we're sticking with simply a generic designer. But according to the flavor text on "Thunes Mekaniske Verksted", I figured a 5% production bonus to trains for flavor reasons was alright. If wanting super strong tanks, license production from major countries may be the go to solution.

[*]Naval industry for Western Norway in the Nortraship-/Naval Production-focus line now moved one focus down. Requirements have also been reworked on both relevant focuses.

[*]Focus idea-giving/combining in the Naval Production-line should now be more readable.

[*]Improved focus search filters further.

[*]All Norwegian technology sharing groups now somewhat more limited in base membership availability, though being in faction with Norway or a subject of them will always be enough. Also reworked the tech sharing picture to the one with the crown both for the Allied path and the Royal Norwegian Society used in the monarchist path, for more visual variation and topical visuals.

[*]Massively improved the old technology sharing events for the Nordic, Allied, German and Soviet technology sharing groups. Now much more sensible targets/effects, use of FROM/ROOT rather than specified tags and updating to the Allied research, German research and Soviet research from the old functions which added you to the existing Commonwealth, Axis and/or Comintern research groups. Now those are totally removed, and a unique cooperative between Norway and the other major power is always used instead.

[*]Fixed radar location in Vestlandet, Sørlandet and Jamtland, so it's centered on the radar effect location. Tweaked supply node graphic in a province in Sørlandet to make room for it.

[*]Moved the airport/airbase in Østlandet to the location of Fornebu Airport, Norway's main airport from 1939 until many decades later, e.g. the south-western part of the capital province of Oslo in-game.

[*]General improvement of building graphic placements in Østlandet for coastal buildings and the fuel silo, in addition to the airport location and graphics. Now the naval bases, dockyard and coastal forts should provide one of the better mixes of historical and "nice to look at" possible.

[*]Added in one of the earlier Otto Ruge portaits used, as in R56 Otto Ruge had accidentally been using Carl Johan Erichsen's portrait for a while. Carl Johan Erichsen now instead got his new updated portrait, while Otto Ruge got his.[/list]

07.02.2022
Version 1.4.1a - Moderately large feature and polishing update, Nortraship events and many small improvements (1.11.* Barbarossa compatible)

[b]Content[/b]
[list]
[*]Autonomy reduction effects added to railroad decisions for improving/electrifying railroads in certain subjects.

[*]The new state highlighting system for decisions is now in, so states should once again be highlighted when hoovering over decisions and the decisions can be taken on the map as well.

[*]Added some basic repair speed, refit cost, refit speed and/or naval equipment experience cost modifiers/buffs to the Norwegian Ship Designer choices.

[*]Four Nortraship related events have been added, with new event pictures and triggers through the focus tree integrated. There is one standard event upon establishing the trade mission/ship administration, and different news events on historical merchant fleet coordination with the United Kingdom, merchant fleet coordination with Germany if the UK attacks you first and forces you to side with Germany, and lastly one for coordinating with Germany after aligning with them by choice through the focus tree.

[*]New introductory event to the Armed Neutrality focus with light effects inserted before the existing news events about this and eventual violations of said neutrality. Also includes new event pictures and the possibility for the Armed Neutrality event through the neutral focus in the monarchist branch as well.

[*]The historical Armed Neutrality focus now also raises your economic mobilisation laws by one level for free if you're in one of the two lower economic mobilisation laws. In conjunction with the earlier buff to decision effect speed for seeking alliances, as well as the current increased flavor, this should make the truly historical path more eniticing to pick.

[*]Added three new news event pictures and four new standard event pictures. Most of them are now in use in old events and new events for this update.

[*]Added new military advisor portrait/picture for Haakon VII.

[*]Added a new military advisor portrait/picture for Otto Ruge.[/list]



[b]Localisation[/b]
[list]
[*]New localisation for new stuff, mainly new events and event descriptions.

[*]Fixed/added the description of the news event for revising the Treaty of Kiel.

[*]Continued work on adding base game advisor tooltips to relevant focuses, and used the old NaW tooltips for further clarification/details.

[*]Slight addition to the Haakon VII abdicates event description.

[*]Some fixes to targeted localisation and other improvements.[/list]



[b]Balance and fixes[/b]
[list]
[*]State reintegration decisions can now also be taken with no resistance in the states, as an alternative to the earlier 20%+ compliance requirement. This should enable states with no cores of other countries for reintegration again as well.

[*]Easter Egg country's land reintegration decision now targets another state which I found made more sense. Decision name and description also reworked.

[*]Easter Egg country now has their characters recruited through their history file, like intended.

[*]Iceland's potential "Norwegian Advisors"-idea now has one additional percent of recruitable population, to increase the significance of adding this to Iceland as a subject slightly. Also changed the icon used for the idea.

[*]Reworked some old ideas and a focus into a new naming scheme/my intended naming scheme, should not affect saved games unless the "Establish Heimevernet" focus has been done, then "doublestacking the idea" may be possible. To avoid remove one of them with console commands after this has happened, or simply don't do the focus again.

[*]Added ahead of time bonuses (1 year) to the research bonuses for light ship hulls/cruiser hulls in the "Modern Escort Ships" focus. Reduced existing ahead of time bonuses (2 years --> 1 year) in the research bonuses for the "Medium Aircraft" focus.

[*]Eased up on requirements for the "A Beacon among Democracies" focus, and eased up on requirements for the fascist path in general so it's harder to get locked out of stuff due to other countries' choices.

[*]More advisor tooltips in line with base game functionality.

[*]More AI considerations for focuses.

[*]Other slight focus cleanups.

[*]More sensible event picture for the news event on revising the Treaty of Kiel.

[*]Small interface reworks to make working with the custom graphical assets easier.

[*]Destroyer procurements now show up in Stavanger instead of Kristiansand, which is a better compromise between the UK and Germany location wise.

[*]Improved building/radar graphic placement in Båhuslen/Bohuslän state. Otherwise updated buildings file to be in line with the base game where the mod makes no edits (to remove the error that popped up recently.)[/list]

09.02.2022
Version 1.4.1b - Minor localisation update, leader descriptions added again, other polish (1.11.* Barbarossa compatible)

[b]Localisation[/b]
[list]
[*]Leader descriptions for all Norwegian country leaders are now in again after figuring out how to do it for the new character system. The old leader descriptions seen some versions ago can once again be read in-game. Also removed some redundant localisation to tidy up the localisation files.

[*]Improved the "Changing Turmoil" (timed) idea's localisation/description.[/list]

10.10.2022
Version 1.4.2 - Update for By Blood Alone/Avalanche, small event, map and localisation improvements (1.12.* Avalanche compatible)

[b]Content[/b]
[list]
[*]Updated for the newest HoI IV version (1.12.* By Blood Alone/Avalanche compatible.) Some examples include integration of the new map and building graphics placements into the map-files, updates to the bookmark-files and corrected starting technologies.[/list]



[b]Localisation[/b]
[list]
[*]Improved and updated the localisation files. Imported some spelling improvements from R56, as well as improved some spelling and language on top of this. State numbers also updated.

[*]Updated the bookmarks (1936 and 1939) to get the new bookmarks for Switzerland, Italy and Ethiopia, while also keeping NaW's Norway specific bookmark entries in place like before.[/list]



[b]Balance and fixes[/b]
[list]
[*]Improved the targeting of tag and tag-relational options in two events (e.g. GER and SOV should no longer have the wrong options selectable in some events they get.)

[*]Removed now non-used and/or non-existant starting technologies for three country history files. Integrated all relevant checks for the BBA DLC to the history files.

[*]Removed Air Force/Air Wings from the standard unit-files, so the newly added base game air unit-files (BBA or legacy) can handle that as intended.

[*]Improved building graphics placements for radar stations, an air base, etc. in two Swedish states.

[*]Renamed thumbnail image (and descriptor-file path) in an ongoing effort to standardize my mods, and to ensure it can be updated smoothly if the need arises in the future.[/list]
